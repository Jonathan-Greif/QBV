# Query-by-Vocal Imitation (QBV)

In this repository, we publish the pre-trained models and the code described in the paper:

- _Improving Query-by-Vocal Imitation with Contrastive Learning and Audio Pretraining_. The paper has been presented in DCASE 2024.

## Abstract

Query-by-Vocal Imitation (QBV) is about searching audio files within databases using vocal imitations created by the userâ€™s voice.
Since most humans can effectively communicate sound concepts through voice, QBV offers the more intuitive and convenient approach compared to text-based search. 
To fully leverage QBV, developing robust audio feature representations for both the vocal imitation and the original sound is crucial. 
In this paper, we present a new system for QBV that utilizes the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks pre-trained with large-scale general-purpose audio datasets. 
We integrate these pre-trained models into a dual encoder architecture and fine-tune them end-to-end using contrastive learning. 
A distinctive aspect of our proposed method is the fine-tuning strategy of pre-trained models using an adapted NT-Xent loss for contrastive learning, creating a shared embedding space for reference recordings and vocal imitations. 
The proposed system significantly enhances audio retrieval performance, establishing a new state of the art on both coarse- and fine-grained QBV tasks.
